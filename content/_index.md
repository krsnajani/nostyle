Hi!, my name is __Krishna__,

I am a student currently studying law at the Institute of Law, Nirma University. I am primarily interested in academic research with specific interests in critical legal studies constitutional law and criminalistics. My larger aim is to develop a  coherent theory of the inter-connection between the individual, the state and religion in the ever-changing contexts of our digital world.

Apart from academia, I also find myself indulged in music, books and software development.
